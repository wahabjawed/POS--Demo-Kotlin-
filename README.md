# POS--Demo-Kotlin-
Building an app that can be used to search for products that Coolblue sells.

Build a very simple app that implements the first User Story in the backlog:
As a user, I want to search for a product, so that I can scroll through a list of products and find something interesting to buy.


## Non-functionals
We also have some non-functional requirements, which you should take into account when developing the application:
● You write Kotlin code.
● You use known design patterns to build a proper architecture.
● You add some tests.
● You use open source components if you need them.
● You use some images to make it a bit visual.

We have a very simple API that you can use for the assignment. It has one endpoint you can use to search for products.

Search:

Please notice that the information is mocked. You’ll get the same information back using any search term
